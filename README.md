# Kiwi's Siri Shortcuts
A set of Siri Shortcuts I made for people to quickly use.


## 1. Activate Siri Pro Mode

Functionally equivalent to SiriGPT, but much easier to use. Original template forked from SiriGPT.


### Usage:

**Step 1:**

Right click your shortcut (on macOS), or hit the three dots to bring up the same menu (iOS). Then rename the shortcut to remove the `(KiwiSingh)` at the end.

**Step 2:**
Replace the highlighted text with your own API key from OpenAI

**Step 3:**
That's it! Now save the shortcut, and run it from the Shortcuts app to authenticate and allow access to OpenAI, and you're all set to use ChatGPT with Siri! Now you can use this shortcut by calling using, `"Hey Siri, Activate Siri Pro Mode."`

## 2. Activate Siri Beta Mode

Same as "Activate Siri Pro Mode" but uses a beta version model (`davinci-instruct-beta`) that is much better optimized for instructional queries, such as writing essays*

### Usage:
Same as Activate Siri Pro Mode, except you say `"Hey Siri, Activate Siri Beta Mode."` to run it.

## 3. Thanos demands your silence

When you just want your phone to stfu. Pauses anything that is playing back.

### Usage:
Say, `"Hey Siri, Thanos demands your silence."`

## 4. Take me to my vault

Opens Revolut.

### Usage:
Say, `"Hey Siri, take me to my vault."`


*I do not encourage the use of these Shortcuts to commit academic fraud/plagiarism or to abuse OpenAI services.
If you choose to do so, you and you alone will be responsible for any resulting consequences.
